# Get GEO datasets from GenBank

Python script to automate getting GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) datasets.

The GEO datasets are robust collections of experimental data, often including gene expression, comparative genomics, and other complex data types. 

They are generally large and complicated, often requiring specific metadata tagging and classification, which makes them a reasonable choice for stress-testing advanced storage solutions and analytics engines.
